# Enumeration

Enumeration is the process of actively gathering information about a system, network, or application. The goal is to identify resources such as:

  * Usernames.
  * Files and directories.
  * Services and ports.
  * URLs and endpoints.
  * System configurations.

This is often a pre-attack phase where attackers collect data to find vulnerabilities they can exploit.

## What is Forced Browsing?

Forced browsing (also known as Predictable Resource Location) is a technique where an attacker manually or automatically tries to access restricted or hidden resources by guessing their URLs or paths. It's called "forced" because the attacker bypasses normal navigation or access controls by directly entering the URL.
