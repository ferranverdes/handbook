# Terminology and Basics

## Brute force vs fuzzing

* Brute force is a trial-and-error based technique that is applied by some kind of automated mechanism with the hope of eventually guessing a correct combination to crack secrets, login credentials, and encryption keys.
* Fuzzing is a testing technique that sends random, malformed, or unexpected inputs to an application to discover bugs, crashes, or vulnerabilities.

## Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control vs Session Management

* Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity. It ensures that the subject is who they claim to be, typically through credentials like passwords, tokens, biometrics, or certificates.
* Authorization is the process of determining and defining what actions, operations, or resources an authenticated user or system is permitted to access. It often relies on attributes such as roles, permissions, or contextual factors like location or time.
* Access control refers to the mechanisms and policies that enforce authentication and authorization decisions. It ensures that access is granted or denied appropriately based on defined rules.
* Session management handles the state and continuity of a user's interaction with a system after authentication. It includes the creation, maintenance, expiration, and protection of session tokens or identifiers to ensure secure and consistent access.
