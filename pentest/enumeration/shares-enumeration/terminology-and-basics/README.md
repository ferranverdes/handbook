# Terminology and Basics

## NetBIOS

* It stands for Network Basic Input Output System (NetBIOS).
* NetBIOS can supply some of the following information when querying a computer:
  * Hostname.
  * NetBIOS name.
  * Domain.
  * Network shares.
* When a Windows machine browses a network, it uses NetBIOS:
  * **Datagrams** to list the shares and the machines.
  * **Names** to find workgroups.
  * **Sessions** to transmit data to and from **Windows shares**.

* NetBIOS uses UDP to perform NetBIOS name resolution and to carry one-to-many datagram-based communications.
* Heavy traffic, such as a file copy, relies on TCP by using NetBIOS sessions.

## Server Message Block (SMB)

* In early versions of Windows, SMB ran on top of the NetBIOS network architecture using the 139 port. Microsoft changed SMB in Windows 2000 to operate on top of TCP and use the 445 port.
* Important SMB implementations include:
  * `CIFS`: it's a common file sharing protocol used by Windows servers and compatible NAS devices.
  * `Samba`: it's an open-source implementation of Microsoft Active Directory that allows non-Windows machines to communicate with a Windows network.

## Windows shares

### Universal Naming Convention paths (UNC paths)

```bash
\\<server_name>\<share_name>\file.txt
```

### Administrative shares

There are also some special default administrative shares which are used by the system administrators and Windows itself:
* `\\ComputerName\C$`: lets an administrator access a volume on the local machine. Every volume has a share (`C$`, `D$`, `E$`, etc).
* `\\ComputerName\admin$`: points to the windows installation directory.
* `\\ComputerName\ipc$ `: is used for inter-process communication. You cannot browse it via Windows Explorer.
